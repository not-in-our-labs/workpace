https://www.youtube.com/@COMPA-IRD/videos

10 vidéos: 2m15+2m23+4m33+5m05+4m09+3m41+8m11+3m25+4m36+2m33 ~40 minutes

1 - définir pour déconstruire - Définit plusieurs termes
violences VSS environnement patriarchale culture du viol  agissements sexistes  sexisme ordinaire  harcélement sexuel corruption sexuel

2- vox pop - doctorantes "il s'approcher trop près de moi, et moi ça me faisait peur" "comment savoir que le consentement est éclairé"
Pouvoir parler, avant/prévention, pendant, après/réparation


3- la pieuvre VSS. pb de tous les endroits où y a trop de pouvoir concentrer sur une personne (eg sport, politique, cinéma, star). Evidemment dans la recherche aussi
   les encadrants ont un pouvoir sur les doctorant. <!> Domination.

   -> il faut généraliser les enquêtes internes
   -> il faut créer des cadres, AVANT, les pb graves.

   -> mais, pour les univs/labos, en parler = mauvaise pub. C'est l'inverse ! ICI, c'est safe.
   
4- Avancer   
    conséquence globale, sur vie pro et vie perso
	honte, culpabilité, peur de pas être cru, peur des représailles
	"survivantes" vs "victimes", pour être dans un mouvement, être victime ne nous définit pas toute notre vie.
	soins : thérapie, être écouter, l'art
	récits de vie: permets de comprendre les méchanismes
	"traumatisme vicariant" = traumatisme des gens qui accompagnent
	le collectif -> analyser ensemble nos pratiques
	avoir conscience de la violence qu'on peut générer ou recevoir
	
5 - vitcime ou témoin, que faire
   porter plainte, accompagnement cellule univ ou assos
   réagir au VSS: sidération, colère, maletre, dénis, peur.
   agir pour soi et pour les autres, ne pas rester seul.
   peurs de se sentir coupable, du regard de l'autre, de pas être cru, de perdre son financement, sa carrière.
   Vous n'êtes pas resonsable
   
   témoin: faire semblant de connaitre la victime. qualifier la situation. accompagner la personne et être à l'écoute. Rassurer, proposer d'appeler un proche.
   
   a faire:
   Briser la loi du silence
   Que les personnes en positions de management interviennent directement
   L'entourage doit prendre conscience de la posture d'allié (soutient, accompagnement, croire)
   Action de prévention, formation et sensibiliations
   
   
6 - le dispositif à Aix Marseille Uni

7- enjeu instituionnel et biais inconscient
  stéréotype : croyance sur des charactérisques propre à X vs Y. (compétences/incompétences souvent)
  biais cognitif : erreurs de perception jugement, via simplification, sur généralisation
  -> test de Stroop: incongruence mot de la couleur/couleur de l'écriture, pour voir la force des automatismes
  
  stéréotype = omniprésent (et la parité ne suffit pas)
  
  reco aux uni: avoir des services de pro à part entière - des gens dédiés à recuillir, traiter 
  reco aux encadrantes/directions: suivr des formations (reconnaitre les pressions), faire suivre des formations
  
  responsabilité de tout le monde.
  l'égalité FH n'est pas du tout établie, sous-représentation dans les filiaires ET position de pouvoir.
  C'est une question politique.
  
  résistance sont fortes. 


8 - enjeu de recherche
    q* de la pratique responsable de la recherche: parle de mauvaise pratique, mais pas des VSS/discrimnations.
	
9 - enjeu mondial : la C-190
    organisation internationdu travail, orga de l'ONU
	convetion 190 définit disrimination et harcélement de manière général, et fait des recommandations, (alors que def <> ds plein de pays)
	
	besoin de recherche. dans le monde 1/5 personnes avec emplois subi violence/harcélement d'ordre physique/psy/sexu, (et femme particulièrement concerné par sexistes). Violences universelles et omniprésente dans le monde.
	                     

10 Voc pop: deesse Ngone
   slam qui résume tout.

##  Bullying and Harassment in Academia  (18m research like presentation)
    defs, bullying \subset Harassment
	within academia, it includes : interference with carrer progress, funding, falsely negative recommendation letters, taking credit for others work, threatening to cancel visa
	
	in essence, a misuse of power. (nice drawing, types of power @julianstodd)
	  people who forget they are in a power position can cause unintential harm. It is not just about being evil.
	  
	can *occasionaly* go in the other way, where a group of students can start gossip.
	
	   * 25% of of faculty self identify as being bullied over a year, 40/50$ have witnessed it
  	   * 1/5 of grad student expeirence bullying   
	   * 57% can't discuss it for feat of personal repercussions,

   most harassment flowchart advice to speak up.
   if victim: find a support group, talk it through, keep a log, make a formal complaint.
   
   change culture: be an active bystander. (otherwise, it feels like the the audience agrees with whatever is going on

    LGBTQ working definitions, glossary
	gender pronous (what is your preferred/chosen pronouns?)
	gender identity <> gender expression <> sexual orientation
	campus ressources -> also need to think about what goes on in the curriculum
	intersectionality: Have you considerer how the intersections of your identities havec impacted your lived experiences?
	 man/white/able people are not aware of their maleness, whiteness,
	++ questions: the part of my identity that I am most aware of on a daily basis is...
	                                                   least

## Beyond Bias Fair and Inclusive Hiring Strategies for University Search Committees (19:13m from uni, but ted like)

"small wins" approach
barriers? ~70/80, 5% of musician in orchestra in USA. made the first round blind, women success rates widly went up
bias is an error in judgment -> perceived gender implied a lower estimate of abilities
stereotypes are processing shortcuts
biases are worse under 4 conditions (overwhelemed with information + in a hurry to make decisions + criteria are unclear + no consistent process to guide group decision-making)

-> hiring bias for tenure tracks in psy faculty demonstrated, (Steinpreis, Anders and Ritzke, 1999), Brian Miller 72% succes rate, Karen Miller 44%. Same magnitude of bias independent of gender of personn doing the hiring.
 many similar
-> interstingly, for tenure positions, bigger CV = more info => reduced differences in success rate. BUT still many more doubts for women "I would need to see evidence that she had gotten these grands on her own" "I would need to see teaching evaluation"

Mechanisms leading to bias (gender, but also race, etc):
 Higher bar
 Extra scrutiny

Tools for change:
 
1) create a diverse applicant pool 
    (describe positions broadly in job ads, 
	avoid laundry lists of requirments, 
	beware of narrow searches  -> makes run away people that already not feel super welcome
	
2) Before evaluating, discuss and align on critera before evaluating applicants
                  then, reexamine them, 
question criteria 			  
				  do they contain gender biases?
				  are ones based on style/personnality relevant? -> at US stem faculty, implicit template for hiring faculty was you need to be a forward person, almost agressive. Of course, such behaviour is hugely criticed for people of colour.  				  

move from experiences to skills/competencies  (caring about award implies you inherits biases from the previous jury)
read paper/research statement BEFORE looking at CV

3) screening applicants
   slow down, have a consistent systematic approach to discuss candidates. Consider a rubric
   encourage criteria monitoring to catch new criteria (e.g "Is she moveable?", questions most often asked about women), or disappearing criteria "we have no evidence but it is clear he can teach"
   be alert on bias in recommendation letters, teaching evaluations letters (language in those is different based on gender, psychology: agentic for men, communal (helpful, warm, tactfull) for women, chemistry: more standout adjectives for men, medicine: shorter letters for women with more doubts)
   
4) in one-on-one meetings
   have consisten interview process, to avoid bias
   be alert to whom is being interrupted in job talks. (from several ingeeniring univ, female applicant are more interrupted, and have more follow up questions)
   structur discussions to get input from everyone.
   
   
Case study from stanford 2016: created a rubric with all criterions, evaluation sheet. developed interview questions based on those questions. search chair collected faculty feedback, summarized and reshare it anonymously. Facutly discussion started with the most supportive faculty.    Finished with two diverse proposals.   
     



## Sexual Assault and Harassment - Prevention and Support at UM (45m presentation + 45m panel session at univ masstricht)

<!> TW: first part on rape
1) Amnesty international netherlands, report on seuxal violence in the netherlands.
   law on rape in the netherlands not in line with istanbul convention
   rape does not always implies force/violence. Majority of cases=agressor is known. 70% of raped people freeze. police interview focus on violence. Victim blaming. 
   Amnesty campaign "Let's ask for yes". Stop asking victims "Did you say no?", say to perpetrators "Did you ask for yes?".
   30% of students raped at uni keep silent, often out of shame. 60k students in the netherlands carry this burden. 
   bystanders? hard to find the right words. Yet, important to respond in a sensitive way, when people share for the first time (will they share again?)
   11% of female netherland students experience rape, 1% of male, during their time at uni . Don't know where to go.
   68% of male student believe their partner should say no if they don't want to.
   only yes means yes.
   
2) local student activist on the campaign
    scale of the issue -> systemic issue. 2/3 of survivors suffers from long term consequence (socio economics, psychological). 
	Sexual harrassment must not be a part of getting a diploma.
    present manifesto latter
	
3) sexual assault center
   many survivors minimize. "it was just an assaul" "it was misscommunication"
   don't share, try to avoid memories, but have stress.
   share with people that you trust. good options of treatments exists.
   description of a local ressource
   
4) result of a local research study at UM
   Research questions
     how extensive is sexual violence/harassment?
	   ~similar to national results
	   proportion stable w.r.t disciplines
    who are the perpetrators
	   85% male, 61% associated with UM, 70% knew the perpetrator. 
	      aquaintance 40%, romantic 21%, friend 18%, superordinate 1% acamedic 1%
		  
    consequences		  
        73% experience at least one adverse consequence
		  70% personnal consequences
		  30% acadmeic conseuqnces
          6% personnal consequences
		  
    do students know about UM resources?		  
	  93% aware of at least one UM resource
	  52% not at all know where to get help, 27% a little 15 somewhat.
	  70% not at all where to report
	  
	reasons for not contacting a UM resource
	   90% personnal (shame, embarassment...), 30% lack of trust, 20% lack of info 
	   
5) Panel	      
- alcool involved in majority of cases
- mandatory training for faculty? (it is the case in the US)
  sensitive issue, people don't like it. Many form of training already exists, but none on those topics.
  
  uni pres:   would mandatory training help build a culture of consent? or better to start a campaign? 
  center: mandatory training is a short term solution
  student: alcool is not the cause of the rape culture. Important to frame correctly the issues.
  
  tutor need to be trained on their power, what are the boundaries, what is acceptable. We can't hope people will magically discover it.
  consent does not come in every days discussion, a training would allow it to come up, be discussed.
  <!> danger in training that makes it worse, just giving litterature or online course, problematic people can stay in their groups and stay negative about it.
  
  <!> teaching consent training does not work, it is a placebo effect.  [Not sure I understand precisely what does not work. REF?]
  
	
	
## Susanne Täuber - Bullying as a career tool in academia (28:34m talk)

harrassment and inequality are in a vicious circle
Historical intervention and anti-harassment policy have had little discernible effect over the last 30 years.

focus on bias and stereotypes contributes to ineffectiveness
++ we neglect that some people benefit from all that, and use their power to maintaint everything

bullying: repeated attempt to discredit distabilize and instil fear in target
 subtle acts that erode people confidence
 here, bullying includes harassment discriminations
 
in academia, specific kinds of bullying: refuse promotions, refuse to give tasks needed to get promotions , invisibilisations, labeling as incompetent, financial obstruction

very often, perpetrators are seen as two parts good scientist vs bad person. BUT, perpetrators are perceived as good scientists thanks to being a bad person.
example of uni communication on a perpetrator "[did very bad things] ... But the comitee also found that the acadmeic integrity of this professor is indisputable,  he cannot be stripped of his professorship".

people are saying people can be both great scientists and very bad person.
BUT bullying is a mean for mediocre scientists to rise to the top.
  when mal hierarchies are disrupted by women, it incites hostile behaviours specifically from poorly performing men (because they stand to lose the most).
