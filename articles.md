18.9 % des étudiantes et étudiants ont subi une tentative
d‘agression sexuelle, 18.7% une agression sexuelle, 2.9 % une tentative de viol et 3.7 % un viol
Ainsi, depuis le début de leurs
études, 23.8 % des étudiantes déclarent avoir subi une tentative d‘agression sexuelle, 18.7 % une agression
sexuelle, 3.8 % une tentative de viol et 5 % un viol
Plus de la moitié des violences sexistes et sexuelles (VSS) en milieu étudiant implique une consommation d'alcool.
les personnes se définissant comme
homme ou femme transgenre, non binaire ou queer sont particulièrement exposées aux victimations

# Effects of Mandatory Sexual Misconduct Training on University Campuses
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231221124574 


<!> potential negative effects
"Our surprising finding is that training makes women less likely to say that they would report sexual assault. In all three studies, participating in training is associated with a large and highly statistically significant drop in the share of women who affirm that, if they were sexually assaulted by another student, they would be “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to report the experience to the university.
Although our study was not designed to systematically explore the reasons for the drop in reporting intentions, we speculate about it on the basis of interview material and responses to other survey questions. We suggest that training may aggravate women’s perceptions of the social risks involved in reporting. Women students resist labeling their experiences as assault and categorizing their sexual relationships as nonconsensual or coercive in the ways portrayed by training ("

++ bystanders programs
Like several previously presented training and projects, bystander programs can be
transversal and situated between the individual, interpersonal, and contextual levels (Ban-
yard, 2011); these programs focus on recognizing early signs of sexually harmful behav-
ior and developing skills to intervene. Within this framework, bystander programs play an
important role in raising community awareness and creating “guardians” who can prevent
certain forms of SH and/or offer support to victims. The research conducted confirms that
after participating in bystander intervention training, faculty staff also felt that they could
play a crucial role in preventing violence by modeling prosocial behavior, seeking to be
perceived as allies by students, and challenging cultural norms related to SV (Robinson
et al., 2020)

++ intersectionality
On a more conceptual level, some research emphasizes the need to always con-
sider gender-based violence as a problem related to social inequalities and to highlight
the close connection between multiple structural forms of oppression when designing
interventions (Atkinson & Standing, 2019; Banner et al., 2022; Hurtado, 2021). 


## Association Between Sexual Harassment Intervention Strategies and the Sexual Harassment Perception and Attitude of University Students in Beijing, China 
Education, training, and publicity programs are key to addressing the issue
of sexual harassment on campuses (Cleary et al.,1994; de Lijster et al., 2016;
Erinosho et al., 2021). Positive associations between informal education activ-
ities, multiformat publicity, and female students’ intolerant attitudes toward
sexual harassment were also observed in this study. However, prevention
He et al. 229
mechanisms were negatively associated with intolerant attitudes toward sex-
ual harassment. Informal education activities and multiformat publicity appear
to be positive strategies. There may be some problems with the design, opera-
tion, or other aspects of sexual harassment prevention mechanisms that con-
tribute to the negative impact on students’ attitudes toward sexual harassment.
This would appear to be partly explicable in terms of futility in university
prevention mechanisms. To protect their reputations, some universities remain
silent, refuse to inform the public about the process and outcomes, and punish
harassers too lightly (Lay, 2019; Lichty et al., 2008; Robertson et al., 1988).
Furthermore, students may tolerate minor and ambiguous sexual harassment
behaviors as regular social interactions because of the unclear definitions of
sexual harassment in prevention mechanisms. Although female students per-
ceived fewer sexual harassment interventions than male students in this study,
positive associations between intolerant attitudes and sexual harassment inter-
ventions were observed among female students, and negative associations
were observed among male students. As sexual harassment is more prevalent
among females, the positive effects of intervention strategies may be more
apparent among female students. Concerning males, the lack of same-sex
harassment prevention mechanisms results in male students’ fear of experi-
encing mistrust and attribution, increasing their tolerance for sexual harass-
ment (Kumar & Verma, 2020; Shechory-Bitton & Zvi, 2020)

## The gender citation gap: Approaches, explanations, and implications
https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/soc4.13189
" I show that articles written
by women receive comparable or even higher rates of cita-
tions than articles written by men. However, women tend
to accumulate fewer citations over time and at the career
level. Contrary to the notion that women are cited less per
article due to gender-based bias in research evaluation or
citing behaviors, this study suggests that the primary reason
for the lower citation rates at the author level is women
publishing fewer articles over their careers."

"Data from five US universities on 1,571 faculty members’ P&T decisions show that URM faculty received 7% more negative votes and were 44% less likely to receive unanimous votes from P&T committees. A double standard in how scholarly productivity is rewarded is also observed, with below-average h-indexes being judged more harshly for URM faculty than for non-URM faculty."
